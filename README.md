# Data Quality Analysis for Machine Learning Preparation

## Project Overview

This project focuses on conducting a thorough data quality analysis as a crucial precursor to machine learning activities for a student information system (SIS). The primary goal is to identify, address, and resolve data quality issues in a CSV file intended for use in an ML-based management reporting suite.

## Objectives

1. Perform a detailed analysis of data quality in the provided dataset.
2. Outline necessary data cleansing measures.
3. Identify relevant Pandas and Scikit-Learn commands for data cleaning.
4. Implement and report on the success of the data cleanup process.

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: Contains the original and cleaned datasets
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with analysis and cleaning processes
- `scripts/`: Any standalone Python scripts used in the project
- `reports/`: Documentation of findings, strategies, and results

## Libraries Used

This project utilizes the following Python libraries:

- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
- NumPy: For numerical computing
- Scikit-Learn: For machine learning utilities and preprocessing
- Matplotlib: For data visualization
- Seaborn: For statistical data visualization

## Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter notebooks detailing the analysis process, data cleaning steps, and results will be added to the `notebooks/` directory of this repository. These notebooks will provide a step-by-step walkthrough of the entire data quality analysis and cleaning process.
